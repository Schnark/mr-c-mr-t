<p id="story1-2" data-draw="t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6" data-v="2">His friend was called Mr. T.</p>
<p id="story1-3" data-draw="path1">One day Mr. C determined to go and see Mr. T’s new house, but he was not very sure of the way, so he took a path which he knew was in the right direction.</p>
<p id="story1-4" data-draw="path2">But the path was very hilly and frightfully muddy, so at the bottom of the first hill he slipped badly and fell in the mud.</p>
<p id="story1-5" data-draw="path3">However, nothing daunted, he picked himself up and scrambled back to the path.</p>
<p id="story1-6" data-draw="path4">But, alas, he had only gone a few yards when he fell again.</p>
<p id="story1-7" data-draw="path5">Up he scrambled again, muddier than ever, and went on.</p>
<p id="story1-8" data-draw="path6">Luckily, he came to a nice straight bit of the path.</p>
<p id="story1-9" data-draw="path7">But, alas, he was striding along a little too quickly and he came across another muddy bit and down the hill he fell again.</p>
<p id="story1-10" data-draw="path8">Very annoyed with himself, he scrambled up yet again.</p>
<p id="story1-11" data-draw="path9">But he had hardly got on the path when he slipped again.</p>
<p id="story1-12" data-draw="path10">And again he picked himself up</p>
<p id="story1-13" data-draw="path11">Then he came to a steep hill up.</p>
<p id="story1-14" data-draw="house" data-v="2">However, he managed that alright, and then, to his delight, he saw Mr. T’s house in front of him with.</p>
<p id="story1-15" data-draw="flower1 flower2 flower3 flower4 flower5 flower6 flower7 flower8" data-v="4">Mr. T came out to greet him and said “Do you like the lovely flowers in my garden?”</p>
<p id="story1-16" data-draw="chimneyL1 chimneyR1 chimneyL2 chimneyR2" data-v="1.5">He also showed him the chimneys. “My fires never smoke because I have such good chimneys.”</p>
<p id="story1-17" data-draw="windowL1 windowR1 windowL2 windowR2 windowL3 windowR3">Then Mr. T took him upstairs and showed him the lovely view from his windows.</p>
<p id="story1-18" data-draw="path12">They had a lovely tea together and much chat and Mr. T asked Mr. C which way he had come. When Mr. C told him, Mr. T said “Oh, that is entirely the wrong way. I will show you the proper way home,” and when he did so Mr. C found there was a perfectly good road, absolutely straight, and not muddy at all, back to his own home.</p>

<p id="story2-3" data-draw="path12" data-v="-1">One day, Mr. C thought he would like to ask Mr. T to dinner, so he went across to his house.</p>
<p id="story2-4" data-draw="house" data-v="2">Soon he arrived at Mr. T’s house.</p>
<p id="story2-5" data-draw="flower1 flower2 flower3 flower4 flower5 flower6 flower7 flower8" data-v="4">But there were so many bushes round the door.</p>
<p id="story2-6" data-draw="windowL1 windowL2 windowL3">He had to climb up to the window. He knocked and called out: “Are you there, Mr. T?” but no answer.</p>
<p id="story2-7" data-draw="chimneyL1 chimneyL2">So he climbed up a chimney and called down: “ARE you there Mr. T?”</p>
<p id="story2-8" data-draw="chimneyR1 chimneyR2">No answer, and he climbed up the other chimney. “ARE YOU THERE?” he shouted. No answer.</p>
<p id="story2-9" data-draw="windowR1 windowR2 windowR3">So he banged on the other window: “ARE-YOU-THERE Mr. T?” This time a little voice said “Go downstairs and wait for me.”</p>
<p id="story2-10" data-draw="path11" data-v="-1">When he came, he said he’d like to come for dinner and said “Let’s go home the other way.”</p>
<p id="story2-11" data-draw="path10" data-v="-1">So they set off, and soon, DOWN fell Mr. T.</p>
<p id="story2-12" data-draw="path9" data-v="-1">Mr. C helped his friend and pulled him up.</p>
<p id="story2-13" data-draw="path8" data-v="-1">But then DOWN fell Mr. C.</p>
<p id="story2-14" data-draw="path7" data-v="-1">This time Mr. T had to pull him up!</p>
<p id="story2-15" data-draw="path6" data-v="-1">They went a bit further along the path.</p>
<p id="story2-16" data-draw="path5" data-v="-1">But after a while DOWN fell Mr. T again!</p>
<p id="story2-17" data-draw="path4" data-v="-1">Mr. C pulled him up again.</p>
<p id="story2-18" data-draw="path3" data-v="-1">But now again down fell Mr. C.</p>
<p id="story2-19" data-draw="path2" data-v="-1">Mr. T had to pull him up again.</p>
<p id="story2-20" data-draw="path1" data-v="-1">After that, they walked very carefully till they got right home and what do you think they had for dinner?</p>
